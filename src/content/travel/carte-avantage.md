### The card

I have a SNCF discount card which costs 49€ per year which gives reductions on certain trains within France. Each year for Black Friday, they have a promo where you can get 50% off the card so if you're thinking of getting a card around then it might be worth waiting.

For me, the main advantage is the 30% off train tickets, but there are other advantages such as a reduction on train tickets for kids and 15% off SNCF services. There are some exceptions where the 30% discount doesn't apply like when there's a _prix cassés_ which is a discounted ticket offered by certain regions on certain trains.

You can buy the card online, and select what date you want it to start on. Honestly, I'm not sure why they have a youth, adult and senior card, because they all seem to give the same benefits and cost the same to buy. But why keep anything simple?

### Is it worth it?

I've had the _carte avantage_ for a few years now, but never tracked how much money I've saved with it (but I've definitely saved money each year). This year, I want to see how much money it saves me.

My current carte avantage is valid from the 6th June 2024 for one year.

### Journeys by train

I love love love travelling by train, it's one of my favourite ways to travel. At times it can be stressful, like when there's a delay or a cancelled train but overall I find it to be a really enjoyable experience.

I'm going to briefly mention the trains I've taken and the amount saved on each journey

#### Paris to Saint Quentin

I took the TER from Paris to Saint Quentin on the 6th June. I booked the train on the 28th May, so a little over a week before travelling - I had looked a few times and the price didn't seem to change.

I paid _20,80€_ for this 1h37 train instead of the full price _27,70€_.

**total saved: _6,90€_**

After Saint Quentin, I took the train to Lille but I didn't save any money on this train because it was a _prix cassés_ ticket. I then took the eurostar to Brussels and then took the eurostar to Paris a week later - so I didn't get an discount on these tickets with my carte advantage. I wrote a blog post about my time in Belgium [here](https://abisummers.com/articles/travel/2024-06-belgium/).
