Bike packing is one of my favourite ways to travel. There are so many benefits to it, from the freedom it gives (no more bus or train times!), to the people you meet, to the smaller places you get to see. I love getting to push my body physically - something that I don't do often enough in daily life. I love that everyone had their own way of doing it - from the distances covered each day, to accommodation choice to who you're doing it with. All of these things make it a unique experience.

I've gotten to see places that otherwise I would not have even known about. Bike packing is a conversation starter, people are always curious about where I'm going, how long I'm travelling for, and often on hills you'll have people encouraging you which is fun.

### Packing essentials

Packing is always hard, especially for a longer trip. Weather conditions can, and do, change very fast! I am not a light packer, because I still enjoy a level of comfort. We have a 3 person tent for me and my partner because having that bit of extra room in the tent is worth it.

Here are some of the things that I think are essential for any bike packing trip.

**General items**

- a complete first aid kit: all of the usual things you need like pain killers and antiseptic, but also a tic remover
- a hygiene kit: toothbrush & toothpaste, soap (I always take bar form on trips), moisturiser
- hair care: shampoo, condition, hairbrush, hair bobbles and hair grips
- a small multi tool: check local rules because a lot of multi tools have knives
- flip-flops, or other shoes to wear around a campsite/in the shower
- toilet paper
- battery pack & any chargers you may need (phone, GPS, bike lights)
- head light
- quick dry towels
- tent, sleeping bag, mattress & pillow
- a small amount of emergency cash
- reflective clothing for when cycling in the dark

**clothing**

Clothing is a hard thing to get right (I'm still working on this). Even in summer, I will always take thermals to sleep in - I would rather have them and not need them, than to not have them and wish I had them. It can be 30Â°c during the day, but the nights can still get cold. I am not able to sleep if I'm cold, so it's something I always prepare for.

- waterproof clothing
- underwear and socks (I always pack extra of these)
- swim wear
- clothes that can be layered

**kitchen items**

I would always recommend travelling with some quick and easy food to cook. Once, I went on a bike trip _thinking_ we would pass a supermarket, bakery or restaurant. Spoiler alert, nothing was open because it was the 14th July, the national holiday in France. Luckily we did find someone selling potatoes and courgette that they had grown in their garden _and_ we had some cash.

- a cooking device (eg a gas stove and pot)
- easy to cook foods
- bowls and cutlery
- a sponge and soap to wash with
- a dish towel to dry

**bike items**

You're going to know your bike better than anyone, so your list might be different to mine.

- any tools you may need to fix your bike such as a puncture repair kit
- a pump
- charged bike lights (if they're not already on your bike by default)
- GPS
- snacks for on the road: I get so hungry while cycling, so it's important to have the snacks in an easy to reach place

**entertainment**

Entertainment is an important part of a trip. Some days will have more downtime than others. Sometimes it's going to rain _all_ evening and there's nowhere sheltered to sit apart from your tent.

Some things that I like to bring:
- a book
- a journal 
- a deck of cards, or some other small games: I often will travel with _phase 10_, _flux_ and _hive_.

I often see people with small speakers either for while cycling or for chilling at the campsite. I don't yet have one, but it's something I'm considering!


### Rain

At some point, you're going to get caught in the rain. Rain is usually an inconveniences. Sometimes you can wait it out but in my experience it often doesn't work out like that.

If you know that it's going to rain in the afternoon, it's better to set off earlier, to avoid what you can. Setting up a tent in the rain can be quite frustrating. The way I would usually set up my tent, is to put the inside part up first, and then cover. But the problem with this, is then the inside of your tent gets wet, not ideal.

When I know I'm going to get caught in the rain, I pack my bike bags in a way that ensures when I arrive I have everything I need at the top - mostly a towel and a dry pair of clothes.

I sometimes enjoy cycling in the rain, I enjoy the childlike excitement of it. It's a lot easier to feel this way when you know you're going to be able to dry off soon - it's hard to keep the positive vibe when there's still hours to go. On the days where it's going to rain, I always make sure I've got my dry clothes ready to access for when I arrive.

### Some of my favourite bike packers

I think slow travel, and bike packing is such a fun way to travel. Here are some of the accounts that I have really enjoyed following:

- [noflomo](https://www.instagram.com/noflomo/): she cycled the length of Africa and has some really great youtube videos documenting her trip
- [Manon Brulard](https://www.instagram.com/womendontcycle/): Along with her partner Dries, they cycled from Brussels to Toyko in 2019. During this time, Manon filmed an incredible film called _Women don't cycle_ all about the impact cycling has on women. It's a really emotional film. After they returned to Belgium, they created _Welcome to my garden_ which is all about slow travellers having a place to sleep on their journeys! I love love love this platform.
- [meghyem0ut](https://www.instagram.com/meghyem0ut/): She's on a 30,000km journey from Morocco to Tanzania for women's empowerment! She shares a lot of her journey on instagram and youtube
