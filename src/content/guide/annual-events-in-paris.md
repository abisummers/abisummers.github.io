There are many events that happen in Paris (and across France), here are some of the events happen annually. If you're going to be in France at the same time as any of these events, I think it's worth checking out!

### Fête de la musique (21st June)

Fête de la musique translates to _music festival_ which is pretty accurate - but it's so much more! This is my favourite night of the year in Paris, and I'm not just being dramatic.

I love how the city comes to life, I love seeing people singing, dancing and drinking their way through the streets. I love just seeing where the music takes me. It's always such a good vibe! You can decide to sit in once place and listen to the music, or you can explore the city by foot and just see where you end up.

Certain metros, and RERs run all night, this information is shared on the RATP website before the 21st June so you can anticipate how to get home after a night of music!

### Medieval festival in Provins (June)

This is the biggest medieval festival in France celebrated over a weekend that happens every year in June. You can expect to see lots of people dressed up, street performers and themed food and drinks! Provins is a town that can be reached in just over an hour from Paris - on the days of the festival expect to see lots of people dressed up on the train. This event is fun for the whole family.

I have been a few times, and had a lot of fun each time. Dressing up, gives you a reduction on the ticket price! Some year, I'll be prepared enough to thrift an outfit in advance.

If you are going, I would recommend taking some cash out in advance because there are no cash points within the festival area. Most places accept card, but there will always be some that don't or some that have a minimum spend limit. There were places to fill up water bottles within the festival areas (which is important especially when it can be super hot).

### Nuit Blanche (June)

Nuit Blanche literally translates to _white night_ which is an annual cultural event where many activities happen throughout the night from museums with extended opening hours to street performers. Created in Paris in 2002, it is now celebrated in cities across France and across the world.

### Bals des pompiers (13th July)

This is _the firemen's ball_, and which is essentially just that. Fire stations are cleared out, the fire engines parked on the streets, and then you dance! Be prepared to queue for quite a while to get into the fire station, but expect the party to go on until the early hours of the morning.

### 14th July

The national holiday of France. Every year, this is celebrated with fireworks at the Eiffel Tower and more recently including drones.

There are a few different places to see the fireworks from. A lot of people will head to Champ de Mars - here you'll get the best view. If you're wanting to get a good spot, you will need to go early in the day. There are usually restrictions on items you can bring in - such as glass bottles. There is live music that goes along with the fireworks.

There are a few other side streets where you can get a view of the Eiffel Tower from. Again, the places with the best views will get busy quite early so this is something to be prepared for. Seeing the Eiffel Tower means you'll get to see the fireworks, however the angle does matter, especially with the latest addition of drones - if you're looking from the _wrong_ angle then you won't get to see the designs.

A lot of People in Paris, will use this opportunity to climb to their rooftops. It's cool getting to see people celebrate.

### Tour de France (July)

The Tour de France is one of the biggest sports events in France. The end is usually along the Champs-Élysées and around the arc de triomphe. Along the entire route, there are places to stand and watch from - tickets are not required. Throughout July you're able to watch all of their races across France. Personally I've only seen the final in Paris, but I'm sure other places also have a great atmosphere!

If you want to have a place on the barrier, then you'll need to arrive a few hours early, however in my experience because there's ~4km of road to stand along, it doesn't get _overly_ busy so you'll still be able to see. However, if you're wanting to see the actual finish line, then it's worth going early to prepare. The vibe is always fun.

### Heritage days (September)

In French this is called the _journées européennes du patrimoine_. This is an event that happens in multiple european countries at the same time. It's a weekend (sometimes over multiple weekends like in Belgium). Over the weekend, there are places that are open that are otherwise closed to the public such as le sénat, and a lot of museums will have additional guided tours.

If you are wanting to see something specific, it's worth reserving tickets in advance - reservations open a few weeks before. Most events require reservations in Paris however there are always some that don't require it. If there's no reservation, chances are there will be quite a long queue.

### Vendanges Montmartre (October)

Held throughout Montmartre, including at the foot of the Sacré Cœur, the harvest is celebrated. Many different producers come to show off and sell their products. France is known for their food, so this is the perfect place to enjoy all those things. There are always various activities on outside of the food and drink - from night runs, live shows and some organised walks.

### Winter season

There's a lot to see and do in Paris over the winter seasons. You have Christmas markets throughout the city. Jardin des Tuileries has one of the biggest markets, here you can find lots of different rides, lots of food and of course places to drink!

There are also some ice skating rinks that are put up around the city. In December 2024 the ice skating rink in Le Grand Palais reopens after 5 years due to planned renovations. I'm excited to try this out! And there's also often an ice skating rink on the 1st floor of the Eiffel Tower!

### New Years

And of course at the end of the year, to welcome in the new year, we have the New Years celebrations! Everyone will celebrate this in their own way - some people prefer to have dinner parties at home, others like to go to a restaurant, others like to party.

Each year, the entire Champs-Élysées is pedestrianised. You can expect to see thousands of people celebrating here! People start arriving hours before midnight in order to secure a place for watching the fireworks. The arc de triomphe is the center place for the New Years celebrations! Before the fireworks, there is live music for you to enjoy.
