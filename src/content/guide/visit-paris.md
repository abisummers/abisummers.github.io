Hi, I'm Abi, a tour guide living in Paris! I love Paris, ÃŽle-de-France and France. I love getting to share this with people who are visiting. Here you can find more about the types of experiences I offer, and how to get in contact if you would like me to help make your trip a success!

Some of the things I love about Paris that I would love to share with you:

- the variety of food and drinks from classic French to food from around the world
- how budget friendly Paris can be, from free museums to pop-up events
- the traces of history everywhere you look, from the buildings, to street names
- there is always something new and exciting to do, from exhibitions around the city, to live events
- the public transport. I love being able to get from one side of the city to the other without really having to think about it

### What I offer

- Personalised guided tours. I currently offered guided tour of the Eiffel Tower, Le Marais, and Montmartre where I'll share stories about the history all the way up to present day. If you would like to see another part of Paris, I am able to personalise a tour for you.
- Planning an itinerary based on what you want to see, how long you're in Paris for and the type of visit you would like - some people just want to see the main landmarks, others wants to explore the whole city. This is your trip to Paris, so it will be designed around your wishes!
- Day trip organiser. There are so many places worth visiting that are a short train ride from Paris, including Versailles and Disneyland.

Got something specific in mind? Get in contact and we can talk!

### Reasons why I think I'm a good tour guide

Every tour guide has something different to offer. Giving tours is a form of storytelling and everyone will have their own spin on it. Paris has something for everyone, and I'm here to make sure you have the best time!

- I'm passionate about giving everyone the best experience, so I alter each experience for your group based on what you want to see and do. I can understand that everyone has different needs - sometimes kids need to have space to run, sometimes it's important to have a bench to sit on.

- I follow tours myself, both in Paris and when I visit other cities. One of the things I love about guiding, is that there's always something else to learn. I know what I enjoy from each guided tour myself, so I can apply that to the tours that I give.

- Related to point above, I have followed tours in Dutch, a language that I don't speak (I can understand ~10%ish based on context). This gives me a lot of valuable insight into how to get information across and keep in engaging without relying on just words. A lot of tourists that come to Paris are not native English speakers, all with varying levels of English so it's important that the experience is still fun. I speak French, and have followed guided tours in French and English as well.

- learning French has allowed me to learn how to express things in different ways. Not every way of explaining something is going to work, sometimes other words and phrases need to be used!

### Get in contact

If you would like me to show you around the city, or for me to plan you a trip, get in contact! I will send you a short questionnaire so that I can plan the best tour for you. This will include questions like _who are you travelling with (number of people etc)_, _is this your first time in Paris?_, _what things do you really want to see?_.
