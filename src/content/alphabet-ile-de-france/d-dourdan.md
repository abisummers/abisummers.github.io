This week, I went to Dourdan, a town around 45km southwest of Paris. I wanted to visit the fortified château here which was built at the request of Philip II Augustus between 1220 and 1222. As with all châteaux, there's a complicated history with who owned it, how it was passed on and the use. You can find details of the history of the château on their [website](https://chateau.dourdan.fr/decouvrir/le-chateau-fort/) (only available in French).

### Getting there

Getting there you can either take the TER or the RER C from Paris. The RER C runs approximately every 30 minutes, and the TER runs less frequently. The TER takes just under 50 minutes whereas the RER C takes a little over an hour depending on where you are going to.

### The trip

I knew in advance that I wanted to take the TER in the morning because it's faster, so I checked the hours in advance on Citymapper. Since Dourdan is within Île-de-France this was included in my Navigo. I very rarely take the TER within Île-de-France because they don't stop often in this region. The TER was very quiet in the morning, and the seats were comfortable.

I spent the morning walking around the city on my own. They had a market (open on wednesday and saturday mornings) on the main square with places to buy things like cheese, meats and vegetables. I finished my book on the train in the morning so I went to the book store "Le Temps Retrouvé" to see if any books spoke to me but unfortunately I didn't really feel like any of the books they had. Some books that I liked the sound of were translated from English (so I would read it in English) or were not the first book in the series. I then walked back to the station to meet two friends who were joining me.

For lunch, we went to the bakery "Patisserie des Gourmets" and had our lunch there, I had a sausage roll (something you don't see often in France) with a cookie. They had an issue with their card machine because their WiFi was down but they kindly let us go to the ATM after we had our lunch, which was close. I usually carry a small about of cash because sometimes you can only pay by card if you have a minimum spend, but I didn't have any on me today.

After lunch, we went into the château. In France, I really like that they often ask if there are any of the conditions for the reduced ticket - under 26, a student, being unemployed etc. I don't fall into any of these categories anymore so I paid the full price of 5€ (reduced price is 3,5€).

The visit to the château is mostly outside. There are some stairs that you climb to get to the top - but they are quite steep, narrow and uneven. They have a rope to help you. (I really hate walking down spiral stairs).

You get a nice view of the city and church from the top. It really is impressive to see how thick the walls are - I'm sure I could lie down on the wall and not be close to touching the edge.

If the weather was nicer, then I would have like to have a picnic in the forest. While it didn't pour down with rain, it definitely felt like it could have changed at the drop of a hat.

### Recommendations

- Check the opening hours of the château if you want to visit - it's closed on mondays, tuesdays, thursday and friday mornings and closes for lunch every day. Last entry is 45 minutes before closure.
- Every year, they host a medieval festival on the first weekend of June. I haven't been to this one but I imagine the vibe is a lot of fun.

### What I spent

- transport is included in my monthly [Navigo](/articles/navigo/) (the monthly ticket costs 86,40€)
- I had lunch from a bakery which was 7,30€
- entry to the château cost 5€
