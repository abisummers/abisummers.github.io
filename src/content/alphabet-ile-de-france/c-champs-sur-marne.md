This week, I went to Champs-sur-Marne to visit the château. I came across this place while looking at the list of [national monuments](https://www.monuments-nationaux.fr) in Île-de-France.

The construction started in 1703 and finished in 1707, it was originally built as a [_maison de plaisance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustschloss) for Paul Poisson de Bourvallais. Over the years, it was owned by many different people, until it ended up being own by the French state in 1939. There is too much history to cover here, but if you would like to know more about the château, you can find information on their [website](https://www.chateau-champs-sur-marne.fr/en/discover/history-of-the-chateau-de-champs-sur-marne).

### Getting there

Getting there from Paris is pretty simple, you can take the RER A from Paris (there are multiple stops in Paris where you can take the RER from) to Noisiel. From there, it's a 25 minute walk to the château.

If you would prefer to not walk, there are bus options from the RER station Noisy - Champs, Noisiel and Torcy. CityMapper and Google Maps both work well for up to date travel information.

I walked from the station to the château and I'm pleased I did - for pretty much the entire walk you're surrounded by trees. At this time of year, the trees all feel so vibrant and fill me with inspiration.

### The trip

I arrived in Noisiel and picked up lunch from the bakery "Les Saveurs de Noisiel". I had a "friand au fromage" and two small desserts. They had some sandwiches but I didn't feel like any of the options they had. I put my lunch in my bag and then walked to the château.

I arrived at the grounds of the château just before 12. The château closes for lunch between 12:15 and 13:30 with the last entry being 30 minutes before. To get into the grounds, they have security who check your bags. The person who checked mine was super friendly, he asked if I was here for a picnic and pointed out where the picnic area is on the map. Access to the gardens is free.

I walked around the gardens and it was as if I owned the palace myself. At the bottom of the gardens, I sat on a bench to eat my lunch and journal while facing the château. Looking at all of the shades of green gave me the desire to paint, which is something I'm not very good at and haven't done it for a long time. If I go again, maybe I'll bring a sketchpad and some pencils.

After lunch, I slowly walked back up towards the château because it would soon be reopening. Just as I reached the top, it started to rain. I put my rain jacket back on for the short walk, bought my ticket and then went into the château, thankfully avoiding most of the rain. I had the choice of either wearing my backpack on my front, or leaving it at the entrance with a number on it. I opted to leave my bag because I'd rather not wear my backpack on my front, there is nothing in it that I would need during the visit and there was a person at the entrance the entire time.

I spent about 45 minutes in the château over the two floors. When visiting châteaux I find it super interesting to think about how differently people (especially the rich & influential) lived in the past. In this château, there's a different dining room for the children, a different set of stairs for the people who worked here, and lots of art in each room. The details in each room always amaze me - from painted doors, to tapestry and the details on the ceiling.

There's currently a costume exhibition on until the 19th May 2024, so you can see the different types of clothing that rich people would have worn.

### Recommendations

- check the opening hours of the château including when they stop admission before their closing hours

### What I spent

- transport is included in my monthly [Navigo](https://abisummers.com/articles/navigo) (the monthly ticket costs 86,40€)
- for lunch, I spent 5,40€ at a bakery
- the entry into the château is 9€ (or free if you're an EU resident and under 26)
