Auvers-sur-Oise: 19th March 2024

This week, I went to Auvers-sur-Oise as a solo day trip. This was my second time here, the first time being back in 2020. 

Auvers-sur-Oise is a town 27km away from Paris in the north west. It is known because of the now famous impressionist painters who took inspiraiton & worked here in the 1800s, most notable Vincent van Gogh who is buried here.

### Planning (transport)
There are a few different ways of getting there depending on the part of Paris that you're travelling from, and the funny thing is, each time I checked the directions a different route was proposed and the options were different between google maps & city mapper.

Going there, I took the H line to Méry-sur-Oise and then walked the 35 minutes to Auvers-sur-oise. The proposed option was to take the H train to Valmondois and then change trains to another H line with a 20 minute wait. Since the weather was good, I opted for taking a direct train and walking. If I planned the timing differently, I could have taken a bus from Méry-sur-oise but the bus was super infrequent (between every hour and every two hours)

I wasn't sure how I would come back, but I knew that there were different options depending on what time I wanted to leave at. I did however check the planned works for the H line to know what time the last train was leaving at. 

In the end, I took the 9517 bus to Cergy and then the RER back into Paris.

### The trip

The weather was great, especially for the time of year. I would definitely recommend going when the weather is nice (if you can plan it this way) because pretty much everything is outside.

On my walk from the train station, I went for a walk in the park of Château de Méry-sur-Oise. You can't get to the château, but the park was nice and they had an area for picnicking - I could imagine sitting there with friends and making daisy crowns.

Once I arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise, I went to the tourist office and used the toilets there (bring your own toilet paper), before walking up to the tomb of Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Outside of the cemetery, there's some information (in English and French) about the life of van Gogh, his time here and his death. 

Just across from the cemetery, there is a sign with one of van Gogh's more famous paintings "Wheatfield with Crows" which is part of the painters walk that you can do.

After visiting the tomb of van Gogh and the inspiration for the wheatfield painting, I walked back towards the main town. It's really interesting to see the inspiration behind some of the paintings.

I then stopped for lunch at Palais d'Auvers. The restaurant got pretty busy, so if you're going with a group it's probably worth making a reservation (some of the tables were reserved when I arrived).

After lunch, I walked towards Château d'Auvers. I wanted to go to the exhibition, but they didn't have any available slots for the next hour and a half. So I walked around the gardens, and then sat and journalled for a bit. I didn't want to have any time constraints on the day which is why I didn't reserve a ticket in advance.


### Things to note
You need to plan ahead if there are specific things you want to see here. A lot of museums are only opened on certain days, for example the "House-Workshop of Daubigny" is only open on weekends, while the "Maison de Van Gogh" is closed on mondays and tuesdays.

### What I spent
Since I have the monthly Navigo card, I didn't have to pay anything for transport. 
I had lunch at Palais d'Auvers which cost 15,5€ for the menu midi (entre, plat et dessert)
