title: May 2024 Review

**This article is not yet complete. It will be completed at the end of the month**

May has been a busy month, I'm so pleased the weather is starting to get warmer and that the days are getting lighter (it's now light after 9pm!)

### Paris life 

At the start of the month, I went to the Turkish festiculture event which involved a lot of great Turkish food. After the event we went for beer at BBP Canal. I enjoy drinking beer but I like a very specific type of beer - the fruit and/or sour beers, which you don't really find in normal bars in Paris. 

I've been to two different exhibitions this month
- PrÃ©sences arabes exhibtion at the MaM
- France sous leur yeux

and I've also went to MusÃ©e Carnavalet, a free museum on the history of Paris in Le Marais. I've been here a few times, and each time I end up in a different part - I find the flow of the museum quite hard to follow, but I still enjoy my time there.

I went to my first Shakespeare and Co event. The event was with Sheila Heti on her latest book "Alphabetical Diaries". I went with someone I met through a facebook group (I would have been happy going on my own too) and we went for a drink before the event. All the seats were taken by the time we had arrived, but we were still able to hear. I know for next time, that it's better to arrive in advance. At the end of the talk, I bought a copy of the book and has it signed by her. Earlier this year, I read another one of her books Motherhood which I found to be super interesting. 

On top of the blog posts as part of my ÃŽle-de-France project, I also posted two other articles:
    - different museums cards. I've been going to quite a lot of exhibitions recently (compared to my norm) so I wanted to keep track to see if my museum cards are actually going to save me money, or if I'm better just buying tickets for the exhibitions that I want to see
    - parks in Le Marais. This was inspired by a morning exploring the area on my own

And I've also been able to catch up with some friends that I haven't seen for a while. With an ex-colleague we went for beer, and with some other ex-colleagues we went for lunch (we had dosas which I love). I was able to give them some chocolate and Irn-Bru that I got when I was last back in the UK. 

### Day trips

I'm still working on my ÃŽle-de-France alphabet project so I did some day trips:

- Ville d'Avray
- Nemours
- Parc Kellermann 
- Rueil-Malmaison
- Houdan

I went to Yerres but I was having a _bad day_ so I came home early. You know the days where _everything_  just makes you angry or frustrated? Yeah, it was one of those days despite the good weather. I will be back to Yerres sometime soon so that I can complete my blog post on it.

### Books

I'm part of a book club, and each month we meet to exchange books, to talk about the books we've read and everything else in life. This month we went for fluffy pancakes which were pretty good.

My book club book this month was **"Working Hard, Hardly Working"** which honestly wasn't my favourite book. I feel like a lot of the tools she spoke about are things that I already do in my daily life (both personally and professionally) so I didn't take much away from it.

I also read **"Metamorphosis"** by Kafka. I very rarely read classic books because it's not my favourite writing style. I wasn't sure how to rate this books, because it definitely made me uncomfortable - and I guess that's kind of the point? But I also don't want to rate highly a book that made my feel that way. I was able to discuss this book with my partner who has previous read it (we bought it while on holiday in Brno, Czechia). I love being able to discuss books with people in my life which is why I often give away or lend out books that I have bought. 

I also read **"A court of Thorns and Roses"** which I loved, so much so I finished it in just over two days which is pretty wild for a book of 400 pages. It's different to my normal reading style, but I wanted something a bit different. I've already ordered the second and third book in the series. 

And I have reading **"Alphabetical Diaries"**. I'm really enjoying this so far, it's very different to anything I've ever read before. It feels so personal, so vulnerable. In her talk, she spoke about how three themes came up for her a lot over the 10 years of her diary - and it got me thinking about what my themes would be (because I definitely tell the same stories and write the same thoughts in my journal a lot).

### Journalling

I love journalling, my journal comes with me pretty much everywhere I go. I enjoy use the quiet moments in the day to sit with my thoughts rather than spending the day on social media (it doesn't always turn out that way). 

I'm part of a JoClub, a journalling community, and at the start of each month we try to set intentions for the month with the rule being one of them is a soul goal. 

My goals of the month were:
- write at least four blog posts this month and share them on instagram
- complete the 21 day self awareness challenge 
- follow up about a tour guide job in Paris
- attend an event in Paris

All of these were a success ðŸ’ƒ

For the [self awareness challenge](https://joclub.teachable.com/p/21-day-self-awareness-challenge?affcode=994390_rwcdij0d) (affiliate link), having an accountability buddy has been great and it means I'm _actually_ going to finish it. Line, a friend from JoClub has been doing it with me. Each day we share our insights based on the prompts which has been a lot of fun. You can find her instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/line.louise.hansen/) where she shares her writing and photography.

I also took the time to write up my responses from 2022 back when I first did the challenge (where I unfortunately didn't finish). I wanted to be able to compare how my answers have changed. Some were the same, but for others I interpreted the prompts in different ways. I was also able to attend the kickoff session - live journalling is a very soul warming feeling.
