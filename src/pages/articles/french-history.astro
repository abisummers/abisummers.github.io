    <h3>French nationality preparation</h3>
    <p>
      Are you applying for French nationality and strugle with deciding where to
      start with learning French history? Or maybe you're just curious about
      some of the key people and events? Then maybe this can help you!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm in the process of applying for French nationality, which is honestly
      just a lot of waiting. During this time I should be brushing up on French
      history rather than leaving it until the last minute. However, I often
      struggle with where to <em>start</em>, I know there are lots of things
      that I
      <em>could</em> be reading up on but I'm not able to narrow it down. In interviews
      I often freeze so it's important that I take the time to prepare, so I don't
      doubt what I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this to remove the decision making so that I can focus on
      reading, revising and thinking of responses to questions instead of
      wondering what to focus on. Each time you click the button a random
      person, event and fast response will be generated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've set myself some initial guidelines but feel free to use it however
      you want:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        after generating the three items, I should write down what I already
        know (I'm tracking each combination on Notion)
      </li>
      <li>
        the first time the person or event comes up, I can research in English
      </li>
      <li>
        the second time the person or event comes up, I should read at least
        something in French
      </li>
      <li>
        If I made a mistake on what I thought I knew, that's ok, I can correct
        it and then continue
      </li>
      <li>
        whenever possible, I should try and discuss the topic because this
        allows me to see more easily if I'm missing any linking events or
        something isn't as clear as it should be
      </li>
      <li>
        if I only look into one of the items, that's ok. This isn't a
        punsishment and some days I'm going to have less time or less energy.
        The idea is to do a little each day which will make a big difference
        over time
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The data here is based on the <em>livret du citoyen</em> and interview questions
      that I have seen. This will not cover everything, but it's a place to start.
      I will add more people, events and fast responses if I come across any that
      are missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to note that there will always be personal questions such
      as why you want to become French and your life in France so this won't
      prepare you for everything.
    </p>
    <p>If you're applying for French nationality, good luck!</p>
