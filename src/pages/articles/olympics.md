### Paris

I'm a complete olympic newbie, I've never followed it closely but this year I'm invested in it because it's in Paris. I'm going to make the most of the events while they're here because I don't see myself ever travelling for the games. For the Paris games, I don't have any of the additional costs associated with the games like travel or accommodation. Don't get me wrong, there are issues with how some things have been handled like the "social cleaning", but overall I think Paris has done a pretty good job. They have put effort into the sustainability and reducing the carbon impact such as having vegetarian options at the venues rather than everything being meat focused and all venues being accessible with public transport (the raising of the metro price is another issue that has been discussed a lot).

For the ~10 days before the opening ceremony, there were additional restrictions put in place. In order to access certain areas mostly around the seine, you needed to have a QR code. I tried to have a QR code for a museum that I wanted to go and see, but I didn't get it in time so I couldn't go to the exhibition. A lot of small businesses will have been negatively impacted by the Olympics, I've seen a few signs up saying that places were taking their annual leave during this period because they expected that there would be less people. Before the games, there were a lot of discussions around the positive impact on tourism but so far it seems to be the opposite.

### Olympic flame (21st July)

I watched the olympic flame pass at the Château de Grosbois. They had a lot of different activities going on throughout the day. The vibe was good, and it really got people into the olympic spirit. It was nice to see that so many people arrived by bike and I know some shuttle buses were put on to reduce the number of people arriving by car.

### Opening ceremony (26th July)

This was my first time watching the opening ceremony. I liked it a lot. There were a lot of references to French history and French culture that I'm sure were missed by a lot of people outside of France. I watched the ceremony with some french people and it was really interesting to hear their inputs - there were definitely some things that I missed.

I think having the ceremony outside was cool which came with it's own challenges like unpredictable weather and additional security. Despite the weather, I think everyone put on a good show.

It was definitely made to be watched on tv. I think if you had seats along the seine, you really only got to see one or maybe two of the main entertainment parts. You'd get to see all the boats pass, but that's the least interesting part (at least that's how I feel). I know a thousands of tickets were given away for free but some of them didn't have a view over the ceremony, you're really just there for the vibes.

Because I missed some of the referecnes, I posted on a Facebook group the following morning asking for some names and faces that come up a lot in French pop culture. I added the list to my [French history page](https://abisummers.com/articles/french-history/) - a way of me narrowing down what to revise for the french nationality interview. I have a list of things to look into which I'll do over the next few weeks. If anyone knows any must know pop culture references, I would love to know them (you can contact me via instagram)!

I was surprised at the level of representation at the opening ceremony especially from the queer community. This was broadcast to millions of people around the world. And the ending with Céline Dion on the Eiffel Tower was incredible. Her voice is just wow.

This was the second most watch tv emission in France of all time, first place is the 2022 France vs Argentina world cup final.

### Road cycling: time trial (27th July)

The time trial route is a 32.4km course starting at Invalides which goes through Bois de Vincennes and back, before crossing the finish line on Pont Alexandre III. There were 35 women and 35 men with the women going first - it's nice to see that the split between men and woman globally across the games is equal. The cyclists left at intervals of 90 seconds.

The weather wasn't ideal for this race, it was raining so the roads were slippery, a few of the cyclists unfortunately fell. A few cyclists also had mechanical issues, so has to swap bikes.

The route had many free places to watch from, with only the start and end being ticketed. I watched from in front of the Decathlon on Bd Saint-Germain with my partner. The view was pretty good, and we could see the cyclists pass in both directions. Seeing the speeds that they go at is insane, they're so good at what they do which makes it look easy - which it definitely isn't. The speeds they cycle at on the flat is faster than I cycle going down a hill!

Maybe a controversial option, but I think umbrellas should be banned from all events - people are so not careful with them as they move to take photos which runs the risk of poking people in the face, and they also obstruct the view. Surely it's more annoying to hold an umbrella than it is to wear a jacket or poncho?

I watched all of the women's event, and most of the men's event - I had to leave early because I had plans with a friend for her birthday.

Very grateful that I was able to see this event for free - I'm sure it would have been too much work to restrict access and add security for a completely ticketed event. The atmosphere was good despite the weather

### Urban sports (28th July)

With my partner, we had tickets to see the urban park venues - we bought this in the first round of tickets were you had to buy six tickets, these were the cheapest and we thought it would be cool to see. This wasn't a ticket to see a specific event, but it allowed access to the venues that were not in use along with the athletes who were practising.

The queue to get in was badly managed (which isn't so much of a surprise). They had two queues for the initial bag check, and then everyone joined one queue for ticket checks and a second security check. The first queue was ok, but the second queue has no sense. There were too many people with no clear indication on where to go, people were trying to jump the queue, and some where accidentally cutting in because there was no clear way to go.

I think people would have been in a better mood if they had some music playing, to make it feel as if we weren't just _waiting_. They should have had two different queues, one with the ticketed event which was women's skateboarding, and one with the urban park tickets. There were definitely people who missed the start of the skateboarding event because they were in the queue which is too bad. In total, we queued for a bit over an hour.

Once we were in, it didn't feel crowded at all and there was quite a lot of things to do. I like that they had places to fill up water bottles especially considering how hot it was. Sometimes events are complicated with bringing in bottles, but they seemed ok with it.

We started by watching the first round of skateboarding from the side. The view wasn't great but we could still see parts of the track. There were a lot of Brazilian people there who were super hyped up for the event which was cool. We then took shade to have lunch - we had bought lunch before going into the venue.

We were able to see some people practising on the BMX track and practising the 3x3 basketball. We then went and sat in the shade in the 3x3 basketball venue. It was cool being able to walk around the stadiums. It's also wild to think that they're essentially made up of scaffolding. While there we watched the Chinese team practising.

Parts of Jardin des Tuileries were accessible. They had some food and drink stalls there - there's no alcohol sold in any of the olympic venues - I actually think this is a good thing., They also had some games (mostly aimed at kids) that you can play - they had a place where kids were learning to play basketball and how to skateboard which was cool. You could see the Olympic Flame, but couldn't get close from the urban sports venue.

We then watched the finals of the skateboarding. We watched from the other skateboarding venue because they were showing it on a big screen there. There were no seats in the shade and I was very hot (and tired) so I went home early. I'm still happy I was able to see some of the event. The skateboarders were so good (and so young!), that they made it look easy (which it definitely isn't)

My advice for the urban sports venue is:

- arrive 1h30 at least in advance if you have a ticketed event or want to see something specific. I imagine all the queues going forward will be better managed, I went on the first day where it seemed like they didn't expect so many people to show up in the morning
- bring a bottle, you're able to fill it up inside the venue. Official rules says the bottle needs to be 75cl or less, but I was able to take in an empty litre bottle (maybe the security who checked my bag was just kind or didn't realise the size but I definitely saw other people with big bottles)
- check the official bag guidelines, I saw someone who had two flags on the plastic poles but was not allowed to take the poles in
- wear sun cream, there's not much protection from the sun
- wear a hat (I wish I had a hat with me - it was so hot)
