## Moving to France

I moved to Paris in 2016 to be an au pair for a second time (I was an au pair in Germany for a year before). The original plan was to be here from the September to December, but in early December I decided that I would like to stay so I spoke with the family I was working for and they thankfully agreed. So I extended my stay until July 2017.

I went back to the UK, I still wasn't sure what to study at uni so I moved back to France to be an au pair for another year for a different family.

For my first two years here, I spoke English with the kids - that's part of the reason why they had an English speaking au pair. I didn't see my future in France so I didn't invest nearly enough time into learning French.

I'm going to be honest, it took me an embarrassingly long time to learn French to a point where I felt comfortable speaking with French people - but I'm _mostly_ there now.

Here's a summary of my journey with learning French, things that didn't work for me and more importantly what did work for me.

### Secondary School

I had two years of French class at school, which was taught in English. As a class, we were not very motivated to learn the language, and personally I didn't see a future of me needing French (life is unpredictable). What was meant to be a third year of class, turned into European Studies, but honestly I can remember nothing about it.

If I could go back in time, I would have put a lot more effort into French and into other subject, but here we are. 6 years after my French classes when I moved to Paris, I could remember essentially nothing other than introducing myself by name and counting to ten.

### Classes via la Mairie

After au pairing, I did a web dev bootcamp and then started working as a teaching assistant on the same course. The bootcamp was taught in English, but most of the students were French speaking. When I was a TA, there were students who didn't speak French, so I continued to speak in English so they would understand.

I knew I wanted to improve my French, so I did some French classes at la Mairie (via the town hall). These classes were some of the cheapest that I could find and I like them a lot. However, where I was working moved to the other side of Paris so I was having to leave work in order to make it on time. After a while, I decided that it was too much and I stopped attending class.

### Classes with Alliance Francaise

As a birthday gift, I got a week long course Alliance Francaise which was good but I was placed in a level that was too high for me.

I also did online classes with them for almost a year in total. Every tuesday and Thursday during term times, I had a two hour french class after work. I booked them through _mon compte formation_ which was amazing because French lessons are _expensive_ which is why I put it off for so long. The online classes worked well for me, because it was during Covid and I was working from home.

When working in France, money goes towards _mon compte formation_ which is essentially credits that can be used for various courses - French classes, learning to drive and a whole bunch of other stuff. They recently changed the rules, where you now have to pay 100â‚¬ towards the cost of course. You have to pay attention to what courses you're picking because some of them are really bad deals, and are expensive just because people have "free" money to use. The search feature on the website sucks, so it takes quite a lot of time to compare different options.

### Classes with Campus Langues

in 2022 I did 4 months of in person French classes at Campus Langues in preparation for taking the B1 exam (which I passed in the December!).

I had a great experience. The class was pretty small, I think we were 12 people in total but rarely everyone would be there. I really like the teacher that I had, she was super nice and put a lot of work into getting us to understand. It got me to a point where I passed the B1 exam, and where I could interview in French (not perfectly, but _good enough_)

The two downsides for me were:

- the French classes I had were at 2pm-4pm each day, so right in the middle of the afternoon (which is probably why the class was small), but I would have preferred a morning class
- the class had quite a variety of people in terms of levels, and not everyone was motivated. Because of the variety of level, parts were a little slow for me - I was there because I wanted to learn French, but some people were there because they _had_ to be there. At this point, I had a good understanding of French, I just lacked the confidence to speak it

This was the cheapest in person class I could find - I knew I was motivated to get past the mental block that I had. However, because it was the cheapest, there were definitely people there because they needed to attend French classes in order to validate their visas for example. And I know that the A1 and A2 classes that were held at the same time as mine, had more students in per class.

### Lingoda

In January 2023, I switched companies and started speaking some French at work. All the code was in English, and the people I worked with all spoke English so I could speak English if I needed to, but a lot of meetings were in French. I knew I needed to do something outside of work to improve my level.

In April 2023 I started the [Lingoda Sprint](https://sprint.lingoda.com/6DMb2R) (referral link). One of the big selling points is that if you complete the sprint, you get either money back, or credit added to your account.

Over two months, I did 15 lessons a month. It was intense, it's a lesson pretty much every other day on top of full time work, but I'm so pleased I did it. They have a super sprint which is 30 lessons per month - which is one every day. You can't do multiple on the same day if you want to get the reward at the end.

I was on holiday while doing the sprint, so I ended up standing at the side of a road in the middle of a field to do the classes from my phone - the wifi in the house we were staying in was not good enough for me to connect. I wanted to complete the sprint in order to get the reward.

I opted for the money back because I didn't want to burn myself out. You had a certain amount of time to use the credit within, after this period you still had the credits but you needed to buy more in order to have an active subscription.

I enjoyed the sprint a lot, and have since purchased credits twice more. I like that I can pick any time of day (seriously I could do a class at 2am or 11pm if I wanted to), the class sizes are small (max five people) and that there are lots of different teachers. The classes are interactive - there isn't really an option to just sit back and listen because the teacher will call on you to answer a question.

I feel like during this period I improved a lot because of how much I was actually speaking French. Speaking French was the thing that I struggled with a lot

### Apps

I'm not really big on apps, I already spend enough time on my phone and I enjoy spending time away from screens. However there are two that stand out to me the most

For vocab and conjugation, I found the app _Lingvist_ to be best. I tried Duolingo when I first moved here, but I found the sentences to not be useful.

With Lingvist, I think there's a lot of useful vocab - I used it for over a year straight without missing a day. I'm a creature of habit, and I know if I stop doing something, it's often hard for me to pick it up again. I am sure this is the reason why my vocab is good. You can pick the speed at which the sentences are spoken at. Ten minutes per day does a lot over a year

And I loved listening to Radio France while commuting. They have a show call _le talk_ which I loved (I haven't listened to it for a while). It covers topics that are going on in France and globally, the bring in experts on the subject to discuss it in detail.


### What I tried that didn't work

I tried to learn French in a lot of different ways, I had no idea how best I learn a new language - it's something I had never really done before. Often I went for the "easy" (passive) option but nothing stuck

Personally for me, self study doesn't work. If I get blocked on a certain subject, I will just close the book and move on. Not ideal when it comes to learning a language, because at the start there's a lot of blocking points.

I used to spent a lot of time writing out sentences. I would write the same thing over and over, or I wouldn't really understand it. Copying text without saying it out loud doesn't work for me.

I bought countless second hand kid books, convinced that I would take the time to read them - I would sometimes read two or three pages before forgetting about it and moving on. I love reading, I read a few books per month _but_ reading in French was not a leisure activity for me.

Speaking was the most important part for me, but I didn't put myself in situations that would require me to speak it. For my first two years, most of my friends were also au pairs so we all spoke English together.

### What actually worked for me

I identified that speaking French was the most important element for me, so I new where to focus my energy. I very rarely need to write something in French - and when I do I always have the time to look things up.

Speaking with non native speakers. Ok, sure they also make mistakes but for me, it did a lot for my confidence speaking with people at a similar level. I found they were less quick to judge me for mistakes and that speaking at a slower pace gave me time to think.

Investing money into learning French. French classes helped me massively, and I know I'm more likely to use something that I have paid for.

But honestly, for me, the hardest part was finding the confidence to just _start_. It's normal to make mistakes at the start, but putting off speaking just meant that future me had the same insecurities.

I used to be embarrassed about my accent, but now I embrace it. Learning a language is hard, and my accent shows that it's not my native language - plus I find that French people are more understanding to my mistakes because of it.

Integrating French into my daily life. This can be things like watching French movies or TV, following French content on social media or even changing your phone language into French. I never watch reality TV in English, but watching it in French is fun and I feel like I'm taking something away from it - new expressions, vocab and improving my understanding.

### Next steps

I'm still not _fluent_ in French, but I can get by in pretty much every situation. I might have to look up words in advance, but I know I can express myself even if it means explaining the word I'm looking for.

Despite that, I'm still continuing to invest in my French. I have just bought more credits on Lingoda so that I can keep practising. I think learning French is always going to be something that I want to work on.
