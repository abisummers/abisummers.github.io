## Museum cards

I love visiting museums, I love getting to learn about history and I also love getting to reflect on the art I'm seeing. I currently have 3 different subscriptions, which personally I think are worth it. You can read my articles about exhibitions I've seen [here](https://abisummers.com/articles/museums/).

## National Monument

I have the duo [national monument card](https://www.monuments-nationaux.fr) which has over 80 monuments inside France. I opted for the duo card, because it's often a place I go to with a friend, so this allows me to get another person in for free. I subscribed for the year, starting from the 25th April 2024. The solo subscription costs 45€ and the duo costs **70€**.

Has it been worth it?

- arc de triomphe with a friend (ticket price per ticket: 16€)
- Maison des Jardies à Sèvres as part of my [day trip to Ville d'Avray](http://abisummers.com/articles/alphabet-ile-de-france/v-ville-d-avray/) (the guided tour of the house was sooooo good) (ticket price 7€)

total saved so far: **39€**

Despite not saving money yet (I'm pretty sure I will before the year is over), I think it's worth it. I've had a great time visiting the arc de triomphe with a friend (I hadn't been in years) and I loved the guided tour of Maison des Jardies à Sèvres. It's been helpful with my alphabet of Île-de-France [project](https://abisummers.com/articles/alphabet-ile-de-france/). This card is great because it's not specific to Paris or Île-de-France

## Paris museum card

Since the 18th February 2024 I have had the solo card to the [Paris Museums](https://www.billetterie-parismusees.paris.fr/content) which cost **40€**. I opted for the solo card for the museums, because often I go to museums alone so that I can go at my own pace. This is my second time having this card however my previous hard was the under 26 which was cheaper.

These are the exhibitions that I've been to:

- La Régence à Paris at Musée Carnavalet (ticket price 13€)
- Présences arabes at the Musée d'Art Moderne (MaM) (ticket price 12€)
- Jean Hélion at the MaM (ticket price 15€)

Total saved so far: **40€** so I'm now even with the initial purchase cost.

Both the Carnavalet and the MaM have a free permanent collection.

## BNF (Bibliothèque Nationale de France)

I bought the year subscription to the [BNF](https://www.bnf.fr/fr) which costs **24€** because I was looking for a place to work from - the city libraries are great but I find they often have weird opening hours, and don't always have power sockets that are accessible (I do sometimes work from the city libraries). BNF have different locations in Paris, but I would say the two mains ones are Francois-Mitterrand and Richelieu.

It's free to work from Richelieu, but finding a place is hard. The oval room is really beautiful but it's almost always full. I usually work at Francois-Mitterrand, I've always been able to find a space, the tables are big, all have power sockets at the wifi works. Entry to work here costs 5€ per day, or free entry after 5pm. You can see how long the security line is on the app Affluences as well as how busy each of the rooms are. I'm actually writing this article from Francois-Mitterrand.

I have definitely got my 24€ back with the about of times I've worked from the library.

They also have exhibitions here, which don't seem to be that known. I recently went to the exhibition "La France sous leur yeux" which I enjoyed a lot. Entry was included in the BNF subscription (full price ticket is 10€)

## Other subscriptions

There are a number of other subscriptions to other museums in Paris such as Amis de Louvre which gives access to the Louvre and reduced entry to other museums including Institut du monde arabe. This subscription costs 80€ full price (with some reductions if you're under 30). Personally, I don't think I need another subscription because I don't have the time to visit museums all of the time. Depending on the type of museums you like, depends on the best subscription for you.

I also love that most museums are free if you're under 26. I went to a lot of museums when I was an au pair because they were free. I think it's great that culture is accessible.
