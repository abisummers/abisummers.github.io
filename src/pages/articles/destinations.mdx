## Destinations

Looking for inspiration on where to go in Île-de-France? Find some ideas here and which train lines to use to get there. Here, I'm using the most common way to reach the destination but that doesn't mean it's the only way - for example sometimes you can take a train and then a bus, or sometimes there will be works on the line.

All of these places will make for a cheap day trip if you have a <a href="/articles/navigo/">Navigo</a> because you won't have to pay anything additional for transport. The links on place names links to a blog post of my experience there - usually as part of my <a href="/articles/alphabet-ile-de-france">Alphabet of Île-de-France</a>. There really are so many places to visit in this region - there is something for everyone.

There are 5 different types of trains in Île-de-France:

- **Métro** - the underground of Paris and close suburbs
- **Tramway** - the trams that go around Paris
- **RER** - the suburban trains that go to across Île-de-France, passing through Paris
- **Transilien** - the suburban trains that go outwards from Paris to the rest of Île-de-France
- **TER** - the local network of trains that often connect smaller towns and cities to the larger ones. This is not exclusive to Île-de-France

export function TransportLink({ line, info, articles }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>{line}</h2>
      <p>{info}</p>
      <ul>
        {articles.map((article) => (
          <li>
            {article.slug ? (
              <a href={article.slug}>{article.title}</a>
            ) : (
              article.title
            )}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
