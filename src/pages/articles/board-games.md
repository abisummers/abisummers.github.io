## Board games

I love playing board games but Paris apartments are sometimes too small to really invite people over to play board games, or to store a large collection of games. I often like to try out a new game before buying it, especially if it's an expensive game (and they can get pricey). Sometimes it's also nice to have a change of scenery and to enjoy a drink with friends.

Here are some of my favourite places to play board games in Paris - I've been to all of these places multiple times depending on what I'm searching for.

### The Good Game

Probably the place I've been to the most - they have a large variety of games and they're all very well kept. The people who work there are really nice, and have previously taken time to explain the rules of some complicated games. Most games are the French version, but it's always possible to look up the instructions in English.

On their website, they have a filter option to narrow down the game options - number of players, length of game play and the type of game (bluffing, strategy, cooperative etc).

THey offer a large variety of syrups so there really is a non alcoholic drink option for everyone - it is possible to have an alcoholic drink if you're also having something to eat. Personally I prefer board game places that only serve alcohol with food because the games are usually in better condition - people go there to play games not just to drink.

It's possible to reserve a table during the week, but not at the weekend because it can get busy.

It costs 3€ per person per hour.

### LE NID - Cocon Ludique

They also have a large variety of games which are well maintained. They have two locations that are just next to each other, so they have more space that _The Good Game_. Often I've seen group of people who are very invested in their games they're playing - I'm talking about games that take hours to play.

They also have good options for non alcoholic drink options, and do serve alcohol with the same condition of having something to eat.

Pricing starts at 5€ per person for the first two hours with a required drink. After this two hour period, you either need to buy another drink or pay €4 for another two hours of game time.

They have a small selection of games at the front that you can buy.

### Player One

This is a place where people come to drink and play games - it's a real bar with themed cocktails. It does get busy but it's possible to reserve a table until 8pm.

They're known for their video and arcade games, but they do have a small selection of board games. I like the vibe of this place, but I would come here to play some of the more classic board games or with friends that don't play board games often because you know the games aren't going be complicated or take hours to play.

There's no additional fee to play the games here.

### Le Dernier Bar avant la Fin du Monde

This place is big, it has multiple floors with different themes but I would say it's a bar before a place to play board games. A lot of the games are not in a great state but it's a fun place to be if you you want to play board games and enjoy a cocktail (which are also themed). One of my favourite games that I've played here is a game about French politics - everybody gets assigned a political party at random and then you have to debate on certain themes as if you were a member of that party. I haven't seen this game in any of the other bars but it's a lot of fun (it does require you to be able to read some French)

They also host events (which I've never been to) which they share on their facebook and instagram pages.

This place can get busy, and it's not possible to reserve for their Paris location - it's a first come, first serve.

There is no additional fee to play the games here.

### Wrap up

Each place offers something different depending on what you're looking for. Sometimes I want to spend three hours learning the rules and playing a new game, other times I want to enjoy a cocktail while also playing a board game and chatting with friends and other times I want to spend three hours sitting in a park playing card games.
